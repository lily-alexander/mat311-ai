# Reflection on the AI Assignments

For this assignment we were tasked with copying a .ipynb that was given to us as an introduction to the sorts of things we would be doing in out MAT311 - Intro to Data Science course using only our knowledge of the functions in the preexisting notebook and AI. The AI generator I used was ChatGPT-4 since that was just the default that came up with the free ChatGPT account. I thought that using AI was moderately helpful in terms of copying down this notebook because, in the situation in which you do not know the exact arguments or steps to create certain models or visualizations, then you wouldn't have to slog through the documentation and other sources to find good examples. 

One of the dangers in doing an assignment like this without knowing anything about how the functions employed in the notebook work is that if something is going wrong, then you would have no idea how to fix the issues. Like when I asked the AI to create for me a stacked barplot for one column of data and the output it initially gave me did not properly display because of an extra argument in the plot function that, had I no knowledge of the matplotlib.pyplot library, would have no idea what the error message was telling me was wrong. This is what led me to verify every single output that the AI gave me to make sure that the numbers and figures it was coding for me made sense.
